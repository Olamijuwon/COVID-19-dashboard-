# Data Sourcing 
  The raw data of the confirmed cases, death and recovery cases for all countries was gotten from 
  https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data , it is updated on a daily basis.
  
# Data cleaning
  The sourced data was copied to Excel through thr web link.I used the power query editor on Excel to transform the data, remove duplicates, merged the three(3) sheets   
  (death,recovery, confirmed cases) into one sheet renamed to consilidated data. Changed all data types to their correct formats before loading into Excel.
  
# Findings
  1. The United States have the highest cummulative confirmed cases as at June 2022.
  2. North Korea have the lowest cummulative confirmed cases since as at June 2022.
  3. The month of May have the highest cummulative confirmed cases sice 2020.
  5. The year 2022 has the highest cummulative cases sinve 2020 meaning COVID-19 is still on the rise.
  
# Recommendation 
  I recommend we continue to observe safety precautions ( use of face masks, washing of hands for up to 20 seconds, avoid hand shakes as much as possible ...).
   Anyone who show sins of the symptoms should visit the nearest hospital for necessary testing and isolation.
